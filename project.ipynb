    "The Deutsches Algorith was developed in the 80s and was considered one of the earliest quantum computing algorithms created. Deutsch's Algorithm was designed to solve a very specific problem that is commonly known to computer scientists as the Deutsch problem.  To put in simple terms, this algorithm involves determining if a Boolean function is either a constant or balanced. It can be solved very efficiently using a quantum computer. "

    "## Example\n",
    "In order to solve Deutsch's algorithm we must understand how to solve it. If we are given a quantum function that takes in an input that it made up of a series of bits. When it is processed, it creates an output bit. In order to determine whether the function is constant or balanced. \n",
    "We know its a constant function if it always produces the samer output for all inputs. On the other side, If a function is balanced, it produces two different outputs for two potential inputs."
